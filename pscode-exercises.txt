// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

X + Y = Z

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Print "enter any number to check, even or odd"
2. Read input of a number
3. If number mod = 0
4. Print "number is even"
5. Else
6. Print "number is odd"
7. End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) 1. input num1,num2,num3,num4,num5

b) 1. Start
   2. Declare variables num1,num2,num3,num4,num5
   3. Calculate sum = Num1+num2+num3+num4+num4
   4. Calculate average = sum/5
   5. Print sum and average 

c) small = num1
   large = num1
   if n1>ni then:
	small = ni
   if n1<ni then:
	large = ni
d)print("Average:",avg)
  print("Smallest:",small)
  print("Largest:",large)
